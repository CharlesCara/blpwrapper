These are RUnit test files. They need to go in a folder called "demo" since if
they went in "tests" they would be run by default and would fail since I'm
assuming r-forge doesn't have 20k a year (or whatever it costs these days)
for a dedicated Bloomberg terminal. I'd like to put them in something called
"examples" but that gets ditched when you make a package since it's not one
of the standard R package directories.

So, "demo" will have to do for now. Even though it's not an interactive demo.
Sorry. Real programmers look at tests for documentation anyway.
