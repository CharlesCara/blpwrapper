h2. Compiling and Installing RBloomberg

If you wish to compile RBloomberg as an R package yourself, you will need to download and install "R Tools":http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/, and read the instructions for compiling R packages on Windows which is slightly more involved than on other platforms.

The RBloomberg source is available to download from the R-Forge project page, or by checking it out from the Subversion repository:
<pre><code>svn checkout svn://svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/rbloomberg</code></pre>

You may find working with Subversion is made easier by using "SVK":http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage.
