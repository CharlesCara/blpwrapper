Please remember that anyone providing help to you is a volunteer. Please show respect for their time by making your request as informative as possible, and doing as much homework as you reasonably can to try to solve the problem yourself before asking for help.

h2. Search the Mailing List Archives

Your question might have been asked and answered on the internet already. Use this custom search to search the this website, the R Sig Finance mailing list archives and other places that tend to provide useful help results.

<div id="cse" style="width: 100%;">Loading</div>
<script src="http://www.google.com/jsapi" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
   google.load('search', '1');
   google.setOnLoadCallback(function(){
      new google.search.CustomSearchControl('015653941277163542830:pxa_xnbwq6s').draw('cse');
   }, true);
</script>

h2. Read the Documentation

There is an extensive PDF manual available "here":<%= rbloomberg_manual_filename %>.

h2. Browse the Source

RBloomberg is an R package, and an R package is just a bunch of files written in R, so you might find the answer to your question by just looking at the source itself. It's worth a try. Download one of these zip or tgz files:

<%= r_source_files %>

and take a look inside. The good stuff is in the @R/@ directory but also take a look at the unit tests in @inst/runit-tests@ which might have some helpful examples.

h2. Ask Nicely for Help

If all else fails, then you are welcome to ask for help. You can send a note to the "R-Sig-Finance mailing list":https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-finance. This is an R mailing list for people with an interest in finance, not specific to RBloomberg but there are a lot of RBloomberg users on there. Please explain your problem clearly, including the version of R and RBloomberg you are using, and be patient.

Another option is to ask a question, submit a bug report or request a new feature at the "Launchpad page":http://launchpad.net/rbloomberg for RBloomberg.
